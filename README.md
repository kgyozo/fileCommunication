Implement two applications in java. The name of the applications are Producer and Consumer.
The Producer writes into a text file a line with the content "Line number N" where N is the sequence of line that has been written.
The Consumer listens to change in the text file and writes the read lines in a new file

(Note: you can use Java 8 new capabilities for listening to file change notifications)

This needs to be properly tested. We want the tests implemented in JUnit. We are particularly interested to check the processes can communicate correctly across the file

Please, provide a Java project with Maven with the solution to the problem
